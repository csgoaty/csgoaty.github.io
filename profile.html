          </div>
          <p class = >This is my dog Buddy. Buddy is a 3 year old toy poodle which I got a few weeks before the Covid pandemic started so he was a quarantine puppy which grew up only being around my family.
          This affected his social skills as he had not met other people for around 7 months. He grew up to be extremely clingy to me (which I dont mind) but I needed to train him to be more social.
          I used this video to help with that</p>
          <p>It was a little challenging but eventually he became super socialable and everyone could play with this little cute ball of energy.
          I would say that buddy is my favourite dog mainly because of how close we became during that quarantine period as he always stayed with me to keep me company.</p>

            <img id = "img2" src="assets/rex_2.jpg" alt="Rex" width ="250" height = "300">
          </div>
          <p>This is my newest dog Rex. Rex is a year old husky which I got for my birthday last year. He has grown alot and has unbelievable amounts of energy that requires me to be active to keep up with him.
          Fun fact, he was a gift from my dads friend which honestly was a shock to me but I really loved huskies so I was really glad to get one. However I never thought the jealousy for attention between the dogs would be so bad.
          To help with the competitive behaviour between my dogs, I used this video to help train them.</p>
          <p>Rex is really fun to play with and was social since the start, he is a very large and rambunctious dog but he is still a very lovable and friendly dog.</p>

            <img id = "img3" src="assets/bella_2.jpg" alt="Bella" width ="250" height = "300">
          </div>
          <p>This is my cat Bella. Bella is only 2 months old, my parents only recently got her and I have yet to meet her in person but I have virtually seen her through pictures such as the one shown.
          She is a persian breed so she will grow up to have luscious hair as it is common amongst that breed. She is high spirited and is always ready to play with anyone which includes my other pets, however the bird is excluded.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Lastly, this is my bird Snow. Snow is the newest addition to my family, although I do not know what type of bird she is, she is still loved regardless.
          Surprisingly for a bird, she is extremely close to my family and spends all her time on either their hands or shoulders. She never pecks at anyone and is friendly to all but she has not warmed up to Bella yet.</p>
